    <h2>üìú Manifesto</h2>
    <p>
        As a recent graduate with a diploma in Software Development specializing in Quality Assurance, I believe in the power of technology to solve real-world problems. I am passionate about coding and the meticulous art of ensuring software quality. My journey in computer science has equipped me with a solid foundation in mathematics, linear algebra, and analytical problem-solving, allowing me to approach challenges with creativity and precision.
    </p>
    <p>
        I strive to contribute meaningfully to the tech community by continuously learning and sharing knowledge. I embrace collaboration and value the insights of others, as they often lead to the most innovative solutions. My goal is to blend technical expertise with a user-centered approach to create software that not only functions flawlessly but also enhances the user experience.

        <h2>üåÆ Work History</h2>

        <p>
          In my role as a tutor, I have had the privilege of guiding high school students through the complexities of mathematics and life sciences. This experience has not only honed my teaching skills but has also deepened my understanding of these subjects. I strive to create an engaging and supportive learning environment where students feel empowered to ask questions and explore concepts. Witnessing their growth and confidence as they overcome challenges is incredibly rewarding, and it reinforces my belief in the importance of education as a foundation for future success.
